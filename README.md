Conducting an audit of the client's big data practices.
Providing recommendations for an IPO (Initial Public Offering).
Analyzing popular content to identify the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
Role of Data Analyst:

Analysis of Sample Datasets:

The data analyst is responsible for analyzing sample datasets provided by the client.
The focus of the analysis is to understand the popularity of different content categories based on specified metrics.
Visualization of Data:

The data analyst is expected to create visualizations to effectively communicate insights derived from the analysis.
Visualizations will play a crucial role in presenting findings to the client in a clear and informative manner.
Conclusion:

Task 1 involves gaining a thorough understanding of the project requirements, client expectations, and the specific tasks assigned to Accenture, including the role of the data analyst in conducting analysis and visualization tasks.

#  Task 2 Summary: Data Model Identification and Data Cleaning

In Task 2, the focus is on identifying the necessary datasets to answer the business question of determining the top 5 categories with the largest popularity. Additionally, data cleaning is performed to ensure the datasets are prepared for analysis.

Data Model Identification:

Identifying Relevant Datasets:
Based on the business question, the following datasets are identified as necessary:
Reaction Score: To quantify the popularity of content categories.
Content ID: To uniquely identify each piece of content.
Reaction Types: To categorize the types of reactions received by content.
Content Type: To distinguish different types of content (e.g., articles, videos).
Category: To classify content into specific categories.
Data Cleaning:

Removing Missing Values:

Rows containing missing values are removed to ensure data integrity and accuracy in the analysis.
This step ensures that incomplete or unreliable data does not skew the analysis results.
Changing Data Types:

Data types within columns are adjusted as needed to facilitate analysis and ensure consistency.
For example, numerical data such as reaction scores may be converted to appropriate numeric data types for calculations.
Removing Irrelevant Columns:

Columns that are not relevant to the analysis of content category popularity are removed to streamline the datasets.
This step focuses on retaining only the essential columns needed to address the business question effectively.
Data Modelling:

Merging Datasets:
The cleaned datasets for Reaction Score, Content ID, Reaction Types, Content Type, and Category are merged into a single dataset.
This consolidation of data allows for a comprehensive analysis of content categories and their respective popularity.
End Result:

The end result of Task 2 is a single, cleaned dataset that incorporates relevant information from multiple sources. This dataset is well-prepared for subsequent analysis aimed at identifying the top 5 categories with the largest popularity. Through this process, data integrity is ensured, and the datasets are optimized for accurate and insightful analysis, aligning with the objectives of the business question.
#  Task 3 summary: Data Analysis and Visualization

In Task 3, the data analysis and visualization process was conducted to gain insights into the popularity of different content categories for the client, Social Buzz. The analysis involved utilizing Excel for data manipulation and calculations, while Tableau was employed to create interactive visualizations for presentation purposes.

Analysis in Excel:

Excel was used to perform in-depth analysis on the cleaned dataset, focusing on the reaction scores of various content categories.
The data was processed to calculate reaction scores for each content category, providing a quantitative measure of popularity.
Through Excel's analytical capabilities, the top 5 content categories with the highest reaction scores were identified, meeting the client's objective of understanding popular content categories.
Visualization in Tableau:

The analyzed data from Excel was imported into Tableau for visualization purposes.
A dashboard was created in Tableau, incorporating interactive charts such as pie charts and bar charts to represent the distribution of reaction scores across different content categories.
The Tableau dashboard was designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, allowing for easy interpretation of the data and insights.
Presentation:

The insights derived from the Excel analysis and Tableau visualizations were synthesized into a PowerPoint presentation.
The presentation provided a structured narrative, beginning with an overview of the client's problem and the analysis approach undertaken.
Key findings, including the top 5 content categories with the highest popularity, were highlighted using visualizations from Tableau.
Recommendations based on the analysis were presented, aimed at assisting the client in optimizing their content strategy and decision-making process.
